# üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è KenkouMatch

This app will allow you to search for doctors in Japan by practice / specialty.
From the menu, you can search for symptoms (hardcoded keywords associated with practices)
Select the specialty that fits, and you can perform a search for nearby docs and / or create a translation card
The translation card takes your symptoms as input and will return to you the Japanese translation, associated keywords, and associated phrases.
You can regenerate the phrases / keywords, and save the ones you like to your favorites.

## Acknowledgements
Inspiration comes from having a difficult time looking up healthcare before gaining Japanese proficiency, and doing small bits of research before doing anything day-to-day in Japan
